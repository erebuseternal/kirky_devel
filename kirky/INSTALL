Dependencies: you will need LaTex installed on your machine. 

For Fedora (or other version of linux that use yum) all you need to do is run
    sudo yum install texlive
For Ubuntu and Debian
    sudo apt-get install texlive
For Windows I direct you to this link:
    http://www.tug.org/protext/
For Mac OS I direct you to this link:
    http://www.tug.org/mactex/

To install kirky itself: enter terminal, move into the kirky parent directory 
that you downloaded, and run:

    python setup.py install
    
(you may have to sudo it on linux)
